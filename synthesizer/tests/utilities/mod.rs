//! This module defines a set of utilities for testing Aleo programs.
//!
//! Users define tests in the `tests/tests` directory, and the expected output in the `tests/expectations` directory.
//! Users should separate their tests into different files, and name the expectation files with the same name as the test files.
//! Tests should also be separated into different directories depending on the type of test.
//!
//! When the `TEST_FILTER` environment variable is set, then only the tests whose filenames match the filter are run.
//! When the `REWRITE_EXPECTATIONS` environment variable is set, then the expectation files are rewritten.
//! Otherwise, the output is compared against the expectation files.
